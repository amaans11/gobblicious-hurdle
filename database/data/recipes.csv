"Cabbage Rolls","Cabbage rolls are healthy since the recipe calls for seasoned ground beef, cooked rice, and tomato soup.","Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Place the cabbage leaves in boiling water and let cook until soft. When soft, drain well and set aside to cool.Meanwhile, brown the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until the beef is no longer brown. Drain off any excess grease. Season to as desired with salt and pepper.Stir the uncooked rice, half of the tomato soup, and half of the water into the skillet. Mix well.Place the cabbage leaves on a work surface, inside up (so they form a cup shape).Spoon some of the beef mixture into each leaf. Roll up the leaves over the beef and place seam side down in a 9x13 baking dish. Combine the remaining tomato soup and water and mix until combined. Pour evenly over the top of the cabbage rolls in the baking dish.Place the baking dish in the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until the rice is cooked (cut into one of the rolls to test). Serve hot.","Appetizer,Calorie,Avocado,Cuisine,Lunch,Sea Food"
"Greek Fries","Some great seasoning add-ins include cumin, cayenne pepper, fresh thyme, dried dill, and paprika.","Cut into wedges that are even in size. In order for the baked potato wedges to give you the best results, try to have them all be similar in size (thinner wedges will do better for you, but not too thin).Soak the potato wedges in hot water for 10 minutes. Don't skip this part! Soaking the potatoes in hot water will get rid of the starch which helps keep them from sticking to the pan AND helps them become nice and crispy on the outside.Arrange the potatoes in one layer on your an oiled sheet pan. All the fries need to be touching the pan surface while baking, so be sure you have a large enough sheet pan (or use two) in order to spread them all nicely. Should you use parchment paper? Personally, I think these Greek fries benefit from touching the pan directly, but if you must, you can use parchment paper.
Flavor the Greek fries immediately while they're hot! As soon as you take them out of the oven and transfer them to a serving dish, immediately hit them up with your garlic-herb sauce. This will give you best flavor.Serve immediately! Fries are best when they're nice and hot.","BreakFast,Snacks,Quick,Easy"

"Anglesey Eggs","The recipe calls for hard-boiled eggs, mashed potatoes, and a rich cheese and leek sauce.","When it comes to the jam, the papanasi are usually served with blueberry jam, but of course, you can have them with any jam you like, I think sour cherry, blackberry, black currants would be all great alternatives.What I pay attention to is the consistency of the jam, for papanasi I prefer a rather runny jam with whole fruits. Finely cut, sturdy kind of jams or jellies won’t do in this case, the jam has to be runny, slide down the sides of the papanasi and make little pools of jam on the plate…","Low Fat,Low Calories,Healthy"
"Skordalia","It’s often served when celebrating Greek Independence Day, along with batter-fried salted cod.","Peel and dice the potatoes and rinse under cool water. Add them to a saucepan and top with water (water should cover the potatoes by about 2 inches). Add a good pinch of kosher salt to the water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to medium-low and let simmer until potatoes are tender (about 15 minutes). They should easily break at this point. Rinse them again, this time under hot water. And set aside for 5 to 7 minutes (you want the moisture to evaporate)","Dessert,Easy,Donut"
"Scottish Tablet","The tablet is made from sugar, condensed milk, and butter. If you want to add extra flavors, feel free to mix in some vanilla, whisky, or nut pieces.","Use a large pot to enable the mixture to have room to expandMake sure the sugar is fully dissolved at the first stage when you’re melting the butter, sugar, and milk together. You should use a spoon to scoop some of the mixture up and allow to run back into the bowl, checking you can’t see any sugar crystal/grains and it’s fully dissolved.Allow the mixture to really bubble up and reach boiling point before turning down to simmer.","Drinks,Fresh,refreshing,Splash"
